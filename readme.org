Simple implementation of Masafumi Oyamada's [[https://github.com/mooz/org-js][org.js]]. It parses and renders internet-accesible org-mode documents. You may find it useful if

- you want to share working notes that are expected to change regularly and would benefit of sidestepping any compilation process.
- you are away from emacs and need to share internet-accesible notes with someone who doesn't speak org-mode

You can see it live (and use it) here:
[[https://mauforonda.github.io/org/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauforonda/emacs/master/readme.org][mauforonda.github.io/org/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauforonda/emacs/master/readme.org]]

You can point this link to any org-mode document as long as its server accepts cors requests.
